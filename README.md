# D3.js
D3js visualization framework

These are various D3 examples I made and studied

## Scatter Plot
I copied an example from the D3 website.

I wanted to fully understand the code (see code well-commented) and add a few features like if you hover over a dot a dashed line to both y and x axis show up plus the coordinates of the point display below the graph (you can't see my mouse pointer in this screenshot).
